File stuff
	- Creating a new series:
		○ User selects images
		○ Name of series
		○ Section thickness
		○ Magnification
	- File Structure:
		○ Series and section files
		○ Images
	- Opening a series
		○ Select a ser file
	- Saving a series
		○ Autosaved as sections are changed
		○ Ctrl+S
		○ Backing up is suggested

Mouse tools
	- Pointer tool (p)
		○ Left click to select/deselect traces
		○ Drag left click on trace to drag trace
		○ Drag left click not on trace to select multiple
		○ Right click to see options
	- Panzoom (z)
		○ Left click pan, right click zoom
		○ Also pan with wheel click and zoom with ctrl+wheel NO MATTER THE MOUSE MODE
	- Knife (k)
		○ Divides a single selected trace
		○ Chunks that are too small (less than 1% of original area) are deleted
		○ Can only cut one trace at a time, must be a selected trace
	- Closed trace (c)
		○ Click to create a closed polygon
		○ Drag to draw a closed polygon
	- Open trace (o)
		○ Similar to closed trace but does not closed the polygon
	- Stamp (s)
		○ Create a trace the shape of the palette button

Trace Palette
	- The name, color, and tags of the button will be applied to traced traces
	- The shape of the button ONLY matters for stamping
	- Right click to modify the palette trace (name, color, tags, radius)
	- Numbers access palette traces
		○ Shift+Number for second row
		○ Combine number or shift+number with ctrl to modify (like with right-click)

Other Mouse/Keyboard Functions
	- Move up and down sections by scrolling, PgUp/PgDown, or the buttons in the bottom corner
	- Ctrl+M Merge traces
	- Ctrl+D Deselect all traces
	- Ctrl+F Find all instances of a trace on the section
	- Ctrl+C Copy a traces or traces
	- Ctrl+X Cut a trace or traces
	- Ctrl+V Paste
	- Ctrl+B Apply clipboard attributes to selected traces
	- Ctrl+G Go to a specific section number
	- Ctrl+T Manually set the transformation for the section
	- Ctrl+H Hide the selected traces
	- Ctrl+Q Quit
	- Ctrl+O Open a series
	- Ctrl+N Create a new series
	- Ctrl+Shift+O Open an object table
	- Ctrl+Shift+T Open a trace table
	- Ctrl+Shift+H Hide or Unhide all traces on the section
	- Ctrl+Shift+A Change the alignment for the series

Alignments:
	- Series are set to the default alignment
	- User can create and name new alignments
	- Any new transforms (imported or manual) will be saved to the current alignment

Object List:
	- Views all objects through the series
	- Only needs to load once -- refreshes as the user traces
	- Can be filtered by groups, tags, or regex
	- Right click allows user to modify the object (name, color, tags, groups, trace radii)
	- Generate 3D
		○ Can be done through the menubar, right-click, or double-click
		○ Press s on the 3D scene to add the scale cube
		○ User can edit scale cube size and 3D opacity from object list menu
	- User can create a ztrace from an object

Trace List:
	- Allows user to view and edit traces
	- Traces of the same name are shown in order of creation
	- Double-click to set the field view to the trace

Ztrace list:
	- Views ztraces
	- Does NOT auto-refresh if a new ztrace is create while this list is open; must refresh
	- User can smooth z-traces

XML and JSON:
	- The program can open and edit on XML files, but some data will be lost (object groups, trace tags)
		○ Will also be slower
	- User can export the series as JSON or XML
	- Highly suggested to work in JSON
	- Exporting a reconcropped XML series:
		○ Set the series to the global series using reconcropper
		○ Open the series in PyReconstruct and import
		○ Alignments will be imported:
			§ A "LOCAL_" tag will be put on crop alingments names
			§ An "ALIGNMENT_" tag will be put on alignments without a crop

Trace History:
	- A trcae history is recorded as the user creates and edits traces
	- These history logs will be tagged with the user's OS username
		○ Can be modified through the file menu
	- The user can view the history through the trace/object lists or in the Series menubar
